# Bayesian logistic model for positive and unlabeled data

There is code for the method proposed in the article "Bayesian logistic model for positive and unlabeled data", which is an adaptation of the Bayesian logistic Gibbs sampler proposed in Polson, N.G., Scott, J.G., Windle, J.: *Bayesian inference for logistic models using
P ́olya–Gamma latent variables* (2013) to PU data.
