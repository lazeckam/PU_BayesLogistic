# Bayesian logistic model for positive and unlabeled data

We provide here code for the method proposed in the article *Bayesian logistic model for positive and unlabeled data*, which is an adaptation of the Bayesian logistic Gibbs sampler proposed in Polson, N.G., Scott, J.G., Windle, J.: *Bayesian inference for logistic models using
P&ograve;lyaâ€“Gamma latent variables* (2013) to PU data.

Main functions are in a file **functions.R**.

The example from Section 3.1 is in **example.R**.

There is also a file called **results.pdf** with supplementary results for all described in Section 3.2 methods.
